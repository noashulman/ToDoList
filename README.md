# ToDoList
A to do list simple app.

## Motivation
This is my first app!it's been done in two days.
It was built in order to show what I have been learning for the past month,
in Appleseeds Front-end Developers bootcamp.


## General info
This project is simple to do list generator.The user can write down his task,
then press "do it" button and get the item written on a note.
Each item can be marked as done, or can be deleted.
An "are you sure" dialog box pops up before deletion.
Items are draggable, I used Sortable library: https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable#cdn

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* css3
* javascript ES6
	
## Setup
no install is needed.

## bugs
I would like my app to have fixed headers, but could not make the Z-index work.
It seems that the draggability does not work on mobile version ):
